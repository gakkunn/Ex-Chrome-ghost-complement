# Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2025-12-01

This Privacy Policy applies to the Chrome extension "Ghost Phrase Complement" (the "Extension").

## 1. Information We Collect

The Extension does not transmit or store any personal information or usage data on servers controlled by the developer.

To provide inline completions, the Extension reads the text you type in supported input fields on ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude while the field is active. This text is processed only in memory to match it against your saved English phrases and is not sent off your device.

The Extension stores the following items locally in your browser using Chrome's storage features:
- The list of English phrases you add through the popup (up to 300 entries)
- Per-site enable/disable settings for ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude
- Timestamps and version metadata needed to manage the above data

No account creation, login, or analytics are used by the Extension.

## 2. Sharing with Third Parties

The Extension does not provide data to third parties and does not collect information for tracking, analytics, or advertising purposes.

## 3. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.  
If we make important changes, we will announce them via the extension's store page, release notes, or other appropriate means.

## 4. Contact
